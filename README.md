## 🌿 Overview
The Plant Disease Recognition System is a deep learning model trained to recognize various plant diseases and distinguish between healthy and infected plants. It is a useful tool for researchers, agriculturists, and gardeners to diagnose plant diseases in real-time.

---

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **Upload an Image**: The user uploads a picture of a plant leaf.
2. **Image Analysis**: The image is processed using a pre-trained deep learning model.
3. **Disease Detection**: The model predicts the type of disease or indicates if the plant is healthy.
4. **Results**: Users are provided with the diagnosis and suggestions for treatment or preventive measures.
